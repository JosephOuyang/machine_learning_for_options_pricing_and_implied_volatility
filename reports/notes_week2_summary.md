Week 2 Summary (BSM basics):
I implemented the Black–Scholes European call price in two equivalent forms. The first function bs_price_call uses absolute inputs (S, K, T, t) and returns the dollar option price V. The second function bs_moyeness_call uses moyeness m=S/K and time-to-maturity tau=T−t, and returns the scaled price V/K. These are equivalent because dividing the Black–Scholes formula by K and substituting S=mK cancels K throughout, leaving a function of (m, tau, r, sigma). I verified equivalence numerically by comparing bs_price_call(S,K,T,t,r,sigma)/K to bs_moyeness_call(S/K, tau, r, sigma) on a sample input. I also generated two diagnostic plots: (1) V/K as a function of moyeness for fixed (tau, r, sigma), and (2) V/K as a function of volatility for fixed (m, tau, r).
