Week 5 deliverable:
- Load the full 1 million data points dataset.
- Train the four "best" models from the paper's configurations on the full dataset:
  - (2 layers, 50 nodes)
  - (2 layers, 100 nodes)
  - (3 layers, 50 nodes)
  - (3 layers, 100 nodes)
- Use the same hyperparameters as in Week 4: LR=1e-5, Batch Size=64, Epochs=200.
- Compare training time and test MSE against the results from the 100k dataset.
- Generate a bar chart showing Training Time & Test MSE.
- Generate MSE curve plots (train/test) for these four models.
- Summarize findings, comparing with previous results and the paper.
