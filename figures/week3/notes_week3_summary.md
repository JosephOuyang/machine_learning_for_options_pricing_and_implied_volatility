Week 3 Summary (LHS dataset generation for BS-ANN):
I generated a supervised-learning dataset for the Black–Scholes scaled call pricing problem, where the inputs are X = (m, tau, r, sigma) with m = S/K and the label is y = V/K. To construct X with good coverage across the 4-dimensional domain, I used Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), which enforces near-uniform coverage in each dimension and avoids the clumping typical of naive random sampling. Using the Week 2 closed-form scaled Black–Scholes formula, I computed V/K for each sampled point and assembled a tensor of shape (n, 5) with columns [m, tau, r, sigma, V/K]. I enforced basic domain validity checks (m>0, tau>0, sigma>0) and a no-arbitrage bound check (0 <= V/K <= m, since 0 <= V <= S). I saved the final dataset (n = 1000000) as a PyTorch tensor, produced a 2×2 histogram figure (showing the empirical distributions of the four input dimensions), and produced a 3x2 scatterplot figure (showing the pairwise distributions of the four input dimensions); the first artifact was saved to the run folder, and the second/third artifacts were saved to the figures folder. Finally, I wrote a “data card” summarizing the target parameter ranges, realized min/max in the generated data, and a reference to the histogram/scatterplot screenshots for documentation.
